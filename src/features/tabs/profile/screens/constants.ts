  info: `I’m a seasoned Software Development Engineer with 9+ years of experience in mobile app development (React Native, Android, iOS, JavaScript, TypeScript). I design and deliver scalable, high-performance mobile applications across HealthTech, EdTech, Charity, E-Commerce, and Social Platforms — guiding projects from concept to App Store / Play Store launch. I excel in fast-paced, collaborative environments, translating complex requirements into robust, user-centric solutions that elevate user experience and set industry benchmarks. Passionate about clean, maintainable code and agile development, I continuously explore emerging technologies while driving technical excellence, mentorship, and innovation.
  
Currently based in India, I’m equipped with a full remote setup (MacBook, iOS/Android devices, reliable internet, ergonomic workspace).
  
I’m an immediate joiner, open to full-time/part-time or contract roles.
